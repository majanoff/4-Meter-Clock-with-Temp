This code is for an analog meter clock/temperature display using 4 vintage Westinghouse 50 ma meters with the shunts removed. The clock shows the hours, minutes, seconds and temperature on 4 individual analog meters. The program runs on an arduino Nano and uses a SHTC3 temp/humidity sensor and a DS3231 RTC for the time. The time and temperature are displayed using PWM with a lookup table for each of the meters.
